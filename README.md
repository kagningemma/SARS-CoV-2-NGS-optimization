# SARS-CoV-2-NGS-optimization
This repository contains files created when analyzing data in relation with the ARTIC protocol for SARS-CoV-2 using minION and Illumina novaSEQ approaches.<br>
The file 'SARS-CoV-2-MiNion-2.ipynb' contains the scripts for data analysis of nanopore data. Data generated by Illumina novaSEQ sequencer was analyzed using a workflow in CLC genomics workbench v20.0.4 described [here](https://resources.qiagenbioinformatics.com/manuals/biomedicalgenomicsanalysis/current/index.php?manual=Identify_QIAseq_SARS_CoV_2_Low_Frequency_Shared_Variants_Ill.html).
A manuscript containing results from the experimental study comparing both ARTIC-protocols is under preparation. <hr>
